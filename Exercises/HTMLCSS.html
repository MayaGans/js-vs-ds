<h1>Cutting Corners</h1>
<h2>What does your browser display if you forget to close a paragraph or list item tag like this:</h2>

<!-- The paragraphs are still able to render -->
<p>This paragraph starts but doesn't officially end.

<p>Another paragraph starts here but also doesn't end.

<ul>
<!-- The list items are also displayed as desired! -->
  <li>First item in the list isn't closed.
  <li>Neither is the second.
</ul>

<h2>What happens if you don’t close a ul or ol list? </h2>

<!-- ul not closed -->
<ul>
  <li>First item in the list isn't closed.
  <li>Neither is the second.
  
<!-- The list items are still displayed as desired! -->

<!-- ol not closed -->
<ol>
  <li>First item in the list isn't closed.
  <li>Neither is the second.

<!-- Rather than begin from left most alignment, these are added onto the ul list -->
</ol>
</ul>

<h2> Is that behavior consistent with what happens when you omit "&lt;/p	&gt; or &lt;/li	&gt;? </h2>
<!-- No, because leaving out these closing statements did not change the intended format -->

<h1>Mix and Match<h1>

		<li>Create a page that contains a 2x2 table, each cell of which has a three-item bullet-point list. </li>
		<li>How can you reduce the indentation of the list items within their cells using CSS?</li>
		<li>Open your page in a different browser (e.g., Firefox or Edge). Do they display your indented lists consistently?</li>

<h1>Naming</h1>
<h3>What does the sm in Bootstrap’s col-sm-4 and col-sm-8 stand for? What other options could you use instead? Why do web developers still use FORTRAN-style names in the 21st Century?</h3>

<p>sm refers to small screens. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp">We can use pure css instead</a> </p>

<h1>Color</h1>
<h3>HTML and CSS define names for a small number of colors. 
All other colors must be specified using RGB values. 
Write a small JavaScript program that creates an HTML page that displays the word color 
in 100 different randomly-generated colors. Compare this to the color scheme used in your departmental website. 
Which one hurts your eyes less?</h3>


<p id="col"></p>



<script>

// create string that we will repeat
var str = "Color "

// create a function that will generate random rdg
function getRandomRgb(x) {
  var num = Math.round(0xffffff * Math.random());
  var r = num >> 16;
  var g = num >> 8 & 255;
  var b = num & 255;
  return x.fontcolor('rgb(' + r + ', ' + g + ', ' + b + ')');
}

// empty array for loop
var y = []

// repeat loop t0 run through the function 100 times
  for (var i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
  	y[i] = getRandomRgb(str);
  }

// print the value to the <p> with id
document.getElementById("col").innerHTML = y.join("");

<h1>Units</h1>
<h3>What different units can you use to specify text size in CSS? What do they mean? What does anything mean, when you get right down to it?</h3>

<ol>

<li> cm (centimeters)
<li> mm (millimeters)
<li> in (inches) [1in = 96px = 2.54cm]
<li> px (pixels) [pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)]
<li> pt (points) [points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)]
<li> pc picas [picas (1pc = 12 pt)]

</ol>
