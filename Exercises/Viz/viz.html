    <h1>Limits of Declarative Programming</h1>
    <h3>Look at Vega-Lite’s example gallery and identify one kind of plot or transformation you’ve used or seen that isn’t included there. Do you think this is because they just haven’t gotten around to it yet, or is there something about that plot or transformation that doesn’t lend itself to Vega-Lite’s declarative model?</h3>
    <h4>Any linear modeling must be done outside of vega then results imported!</h4>
    
    <h1>Working With Arrays</h1>
    <h3>Vega-Lite is built on top of a visualization toolkit called D3, which includes a library for manipulating arrays. Write a small application that generates 1000 random values using Math.random and reports the mean, standard deviation, and quartiles. (You may also want to create a histogram showing the distribution of values.)</h3>
